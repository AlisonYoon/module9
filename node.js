//Node.js is a js runtime created in 2009
//event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
//asynchronous event driven JS runtime (it's JS code run asynchronously by events)
//Node is not JS in the browser.  (node !== front-end JS)

//V8 is JS runtime(rendering engine) in Chrome.
//  Very very quick
// Self contained and open source
// Some people took V8 and gave it a wrapper so that it could accept http requests and run on Linux machines.
//      -> Voila! Node.js
// In LAMP stack, Node is like Apache and PHP
// Apache receives HTTP request, formats the response that is sent to client, Node can do it.
// PHP talks to Mysql if needed, Node can do it.
// It is VVVV quick, because JS was originally built for the browser which is why.

//Node tried to foresee + fix the problems that other languages have come across
//  eg. dependencies with NPM(node package manager)
//Remember to put node_modules directory in .gitignore
//Terminal is now your console
//  -runtime has no access to the web API
//      -There is no DOM
//      -there is no query selector
//      -there is no fetch API
//      -there is no animation
//  -front-end JS !== back-end JS
